### Welcome!

I'm Daniel, also known as dashaw92 online, and I'm a self-taught programmer with 15 years of experience. I like to solve challenging tasks, and I do so in a variety of different programming languages.

In order of most to least used, I have experience in the following languages:

| Language | Example                                            | Description |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Java     | [dan_world](https://github.com/dashaw92/dan_world) | Slimmed down Minecraft world data format for use in [another project](https://github.com/dashaw92/sheeptag-valence) |
| Python   | Osmotic experience                                 | You tend to learn Python just by existing in this domain for an arbitrary period of time. |
| F#       | [BF#](https://github.com/dashaw92/bfsharp)         | Esoteric language interpreter |
| Kotlin   | [DannyShop](https://github.com/dashaw92/DannyShop) | Minecraft server plugin that provides the ability to create custom stores players may purchase items (and more) from. |
| Rust     | [chip8](https://github.com/dashaw92/chip8)         | Chip-8 virtual machine emulator with a GUI display |
| Clojure  | [Advent of Code](https://github.com/dashaw92/Advent/tree/master/clj) | Continuing my adventures in functional programming. More to see here soon. |
| Zig      | [zigbasic](https://github.com/dashaw92/zigbasic)   | BASIC language interpreter with the goal of running BASIC on a Raspberry Pi Pico |
| C        | [COP-2220C](https://github.com/dashaw92/COP-2220C) | Classwork demonstrating my knowledge of the language |
